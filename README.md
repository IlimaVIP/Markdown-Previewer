This project I build with React, Please see my [Markdown-Previewer](https://ilimavip.github.io/Markdown-Previewer/) project.

## This is a FreeCodecamp challenge 

#This page contains 8 user stories:

**User Story #1:** I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".
**User Story #2:** I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".
**User Story #3:** When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
**User Story #4:** When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (I imported the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
**User Story #5:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
**User Story #6:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
**Optional Bonus** (you do not need to make this test pass): When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
**Optional Bonus** (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
